A while back I wrote an article about how I created a PowerShell script for a customer to help them with their morning routine of checking the health of each SQL Server in their environment. I have not worked with that customer in a good while, but I thought it would be useful to update the script with some additional checks.

The original script helps the DBA answer these questions:

What is the uptime of each SQL Server?
What is the status of each database?
What is the status of each Availability Group?
What is the backup status of each database?
What is the available disk space?
Are there any SQL Agent failed jobs in the last 24 hours?
What errors appeared in the SQL errorlog in the last 24 hours?
For the updated script, I have added checks to answer these questions:

What is the status of each SQL Server service?
What is the status of each Windows Cluster node?

The updated script can be downloaded from GitHub.

How to use: 
1. Save the file as Invoke-MorningHealthChecks.ps1 in any folder.
2. Run below command, you can pass multiple servers in string.
   Invoke-MorningHealthChecks.ps1 -serverList 'TestServer01'
3. Out is attached.
